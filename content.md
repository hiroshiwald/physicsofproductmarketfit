This guide addresses a specific failure mode: startups that receive positive customer feedback but fail to achieve meaningful adoption or traction (usage or revenue).</p><p>The framework below synthesizes insights from advising thousands of startups and borrows from neuroscience, behavioral economics, and human dynamics to explain why customers say they love your product but don&#39;t use it.</p><p>Goals for This Guide</p><p>Give you tools, frameworks and mental models to:</p><ul><li>Avoid company death.</li><li>Get customers to enthusiastically pay you for your product.</li><li>Have foundational metrics to raise VC (if that&rsquo;s your goal and you meet other VC criteria).</li></ul><p><strong>Failure Mode</strong></p><p>You&rsquo;ve spoken with customers and listened to their frustrations, and complaints. You&rsquo;ve shown them your product and they seem enthusiastic about it and said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the question: &ldquo;would you use this?&rdquo;. And yet, you hear crickets when it comes to actual adoption and traction. </p><p>The problem isn&#39;t your product. The problem is physics and is rooted in the innovator&rsquo;s blindspot. </p><p><strong>The Innovator&rsquo;s Blindspot</strong></p><p>
The way you see the world is both an incredible advantage as well as the source of a blindspot: your customers are not like you. </p><p>As a founder you embrace change, generate ideas, and see opportunity everywhere, most humans (i.e. your customers), however, are optimized for something entirely different: survival through conservation of energy. They want to make it through their last Zoom meeting, grab a glass of wine, and zone out to Netflix.</p><p>This isn&#39;t laziness. This is biology. </p><p>And physics helps to overcome the barrier. </p><p>Here are the 5 laws of the Physics of Product Market Fit.</p><h3 id="h.yntc60u4p89l">Law #1: The Law of Inertia</h3><p>Principle:&nbsp;A human being defaults to the status quo unless acted upon by a force.</p><ul><li>Human biology optimizes for energy conservation. This manifests as status quo bias which is the demonstrated preference for maintaining current conditions over adopting new ones, even when the new option is objectively superior.</li></ul><ul><li>Neuroscience confirms this isn&#39;t laziness but <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/09/180918090849.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759451694887632&amp;usg=AOvVaw3W8c3zSJGVLNwZVTqgtuby">evolutionary optimization</a>. Our cognitive systems prioritize efficient energy use for survival-critical functions: safety assessment, resource acquisition, and social bonding.</li></ul><p>Implication:&nbsp;Your primary competition is not other products. It is your customer&#39;s current workflow and their biological resistance to and fear of change.</p><ul><li>Change introduces uncertainty. Uncertainty triggers threat responses. These responses are stronger than the perceived benefits of improvement, particularly when those benefits are theoretical rather than immediate.</li></ul><p>Takeaway:&nbsp;Unless your product overcomes this inertia through external forcing functions or dramatically superior outcomes (see 10x power below), adoption will be a challenge regardless of product quality and no matter how painful their current situation may be.</p><p><img alt="" src="assets/image1.png" title=""></p><h3 id="h.opgmzem64qn9">Law #2: The Law of Behavior</h3><p>Principle:&nbsp;Human behavior is more reliable than human opinion.</p><ul><li>Research in cognitive neuroscience (Gazzaniga et al.) identifies specialized <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fs.blog/michael-gazzaniga-the-interpreter/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759451694889103&amp;usg=AOvVaw0osccMegPiPx3sMnnS6pv1">regions</a>&nbsp;called &ldquo;the interpreter&rdquo; in the left hemisphere that construct post-hoc narratives about our decisions and preferences. These narratives serve social and psychological functions but are not accurate representations of our actual motivations or intentions.</li></ul><ul><li>If you review survey data against actual observed or behaviorally monitored data you will usually see a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/m001w7ny&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759451694889608&amp;usg=AOvVaw0NcyeKWNd1OxlMK-hPberl">massive gap</a>.</li></ul><p>This creates two problems for startup founders:</p><ol start="1"><li>Social desirability bias:&nbsp;Interview subjects provide responses they believe are helpful or socially acceptable rather than truthful.<br></li><li>Intention-action gap:&nbsp;Stated intentions do not predict actual behavior. People often rely on their interpreter&rsquo;s reasons for why they do or do not do certain actions, and these reasons may not be rooted in truth.<br></li></ol><p>Implication:&nbsp;Customer development based on interviews and surveys generates systematically unreliable data. Positive feedback, especially, is impacted by the social desirability bias which can negatively impact the quality of information gained.</p><p>Watch behavior instead, especially the behavior after you have spoken with customers and shown your product. </p><p>Behavioral signals that matter:</p><ul><li>Unprompted requests for pricing or contract terms.</li><li>Introduction to decision-makers or budget holders.</li><li>Repeated&nbsp;follow-up from the customer (especially in the case of an early demo).</li><li>Time investment in integration discussions.</li><li>Sharing your product with colleagues.</li></ul><p>Takeaway:&nbsp;Observe behavior. Discount opinions. If someone truly demands your product, their actions will demonstrate it without prompting. If you are not seeing behavioral signals like those above, continue refining and applying the laws.</p><p><img alt="" src="assets/image3.png" title=""></p><h3 id="h.hn0rmrg4fvcg"></h3><h3 id="h.8xfh8a3jwrwx"></h3><h3 id="h.sz2hiwj35vb1"></h3><h3 id="h.g0o7st1x0x9s">Law #3: The Law of Wave Forces</h3><p>Principle:&nbsp;External forces affecting your customer in the past 18 months determine whether your product is a must-have or a nice-to-have.</p><ul><li>The good news is that you don&rsquo;t have to try to create market waves (a painful, disheartening, time consuming and expensive process), but rather you can ride existing waves instead.</li></ul><ul><li>Waves are significant forces that disrupt established equilibria which overcome status quo bias by making the current state untenable.</li></ul><ul><li>Waves are the answer to the VC question: Why now?
