# Diagnostic Checklist for Your Startup: Physics of PMF

**Instructions:** Check each box only if you have strong, verifiable evidence. Be honest. Your customers are not like you.&#x20;

**Intention:** This checklist is a diagnostic tool (mainly for B2B), not dogma. Use it to guide your thinking and start the dialogue about what's actually happening with your product and company.

### THE CHECKLIST

#### The Wave (Law #3)

☐ **I can name at least one specific external wave from the past 18 months that makes my solution urgent rather than optional (the more waves the better)**

☐ **My customers explicitly mention this wave as why they need to change now**

#### Behavior Over Opinion (Law #2)

☐ **Customers are asking unprompted about pricing or contract terms**

☐ **Customers are introducing me to decision-makers or budget holders without my asking**

☐ **Customers are taking action to solve this problem right now (albeit badly, expensively, slowly)**

#### The Incentive Structure (Law #4)

☐ **My product measurably impacts a metric that my customer's CEO reviews with their board**

☐ **I'm speaking with people who control budgets or own the metrics my product impacts**

#### 10x Power (Law #5)

☐ **I can articulate a specific dimension where my product delivers 10x (not incremental) improvement over the status quo**

☐ **I can demonstrate this 10x improvement quantitatively**

#### The Innovator's Blindspot (Bonus)

☐ **I have directly observed my customers' actual workflows (not just interviewed them)**

***

### YOUR SCORE: \_\_\_\_\_ / 10

**8-10 checks:** Strong PMF indicators. Customers should be pulling you forward.

**5-7 checks:** Mixed signals. You're likely hearing "we love it" but might struggle with adoption.

**Below 5:** PMF risk. You might be solving a problem people don't actually have or can't act on.

***

### CRITICAL SIGNALS

**If you are experiencing any of the following, continue to adjust, iterate and re-tool:**

* No wave = no forcing function = no urgency
* No unprompted customer action = no real demand
* No C-suite metric connection = no budget, no priority
* No 10x power + no strong wave = inertia wins

***

### SYNTHESIS

If someone truly demands your product, their actions will demonstrate it without prompting.

Most founders fail because they trust stated preferences over revealed preferences, underestimate status quo bias, and project their own low-inertia decision-making onto high-inertia customers.

**Are customers pulling you forward, or are you pushing them?**

If you're pushing, you're fighting physics.
