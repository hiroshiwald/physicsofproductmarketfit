# The Physics of Product‑Market Fit — Jekyll Site

Deploy on GitHub Pages:
1) Create a new repo (public). Name is your choice.
2) Upload all files and folders from this zip (drag‑drop the whole zip contents, or click **Add file → Upload files** and drop everything). Keep the folder structure: `_layouts/`, `assets/`, etc.
3) Commit.
4) Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: **Deploy from a branch**. Branch: `main` (or `master`), Folder: `/ (root)` → Save.
5) Wait for the green **Pages** check. Your site will be at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

Edit content: open `index.md` in GitHub and click **Edit**. Use Markdown (GFM tables supported).

Local preview (optional): install Ruby, then `bundle install` and `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
