# One Pager: Physics of PMF

Lack of product-market fit kills more startups than any other factor. This framework addresses a specific failure mode: startups that receive positive customer feedback but fail to achieve meaningful adoption or traction.&#x20;

A major source of the issue is rooted in **The Innovator's Blindspot:** You embrace change and see opportunity everywhere. Your customers optimize for survival through energy conservation. This isn't laziness. This is biology.

The way to overcome the gap is through thinking about physics and the following set of laws:

### The Five Laws

**Law #1: The Law of Inertia**\
Your primary competition isn't other products—it's your customer's current workflow and their biological resistance to change. Unless your product overcomes inertia through external forcing functions or dramatically superior outcomes, adoption will be a challenge.

**Law #2: The Law of Behavior**\
Human behavior is more reliable than human opinion. Watch behavior instead. Discount opinions. If someone truly demands your product, their actions will demonstrate it without prompting.

**Law #3: The Law of Waves**\
External forces (waves) determine whether your product is must-have or nice-to-have. Great companies ride existing waves—they don't create them. Startups are more like surfing versus swimming.

**Law #4: The Law of Incentives**\
If your product doesn't measurably impact a C-suite metric, you're selling to the wrong person or solving the wrong problem. Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome.

**Law #5: The Law of Power**\
Can you articulate where your product delivers 10x improvement over the status quo? Products offering order-of-magnitude power increases require minimal external forcing for adoption.

**The Implementation:** Find the wave. Connect to metrics. Deliver 10x power. Watch behavior. Meet people where they are.
